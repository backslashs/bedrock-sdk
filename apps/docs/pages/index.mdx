# Introduction
 
Welcome to official Bedrock documentation!
Here you will find informations about how to create, manage and scale your bedrock app.

## What is BedRock ?

A **simple**, **powerful** and **flexible** backend framework with everything you love from web3.

The bedrock project aims to simplify the creation, implementation and management of decentralised technology through a single, modern entity. Our aim is to standardise what already works well individually into something new and easier to use, a bit like the Supabase project. We are convinced that the work of standardising constantly evolving protocols can save a development team a great deal of work. The bedrock SDK therefore allows complex concepts to be abstracted into an API that is easy to use and implement in new or existing projects.

Here's how it's work:

- As if it were your backend, you create a separate repo for your frontend : this is where you define the operating modes, the features used, the smart contracts, blockchain, etc. Using the bedrock CLI, put in production and manage your decentralised infrastructure.
- For your frontend, like supabase, import our SDK and interact with your backend.

Note that the use of the word backend defines all the decentralised networks involved in the smooth running of your application.
